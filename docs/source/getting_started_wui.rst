Quick HTML Story using "Create Story From Template" Script
----------------------------------------------------------

A user should follow the below steps to generate a story from a template.

* Step 1: Upload a text file containing URLs (one URL per line) of archived web pages (e.g., mementos, captures, snapshots, URI-Ms) for use in the story. Here we have used a text file containing two URLs of archived web pages.
* Step 2: Upload any template file you would like to use. Here, we have used an HTML story template (If you would like to use the story template presets use "Create HTML Story From Preset" script to generate your story. You can also create your own template, refer to :ref:`creating_your_own_templates` for instructions). 
* Step 3: Specify a suitable title for the story.

Aditionally, Raintale user can also supply a few optional parameters for further customization.
	
* Collection URL: Specify the URL to the collection here.
* Generated By: Specify who generated the story here.
* Generation Date: Specify the story generation date here (default is set to current time).
* MementoEmbed API: Raintale needs MementoEmbed running. The user has the ability to specify the URL for the MementoEmbed instance (default is pointing to the port used in default configuration which is http://localhost:5550).
