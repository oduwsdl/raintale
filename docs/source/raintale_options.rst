.. _available_storytellers:

Available storytellers
----------------------

Raintale provides the following ``storytellers`` for file formats:

* ``html`` - suitable wherever HTML is used, such as static pages, within Blogger posts, and within curation workflows
* ``markdown`` - suitable for posting to `GitHub gists <https://gist.github.com/>`_
* ``jekyll-html`` and ``jekyll-markdown`` - suitable for use with a `Jekyll site <https://jekyllrb.com/>`_ and posting to `GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_
* ``mediawiki`` - for pasting into MediaWiki pages
* ``template`` - a generic storyteller for output to a single file
* ``video`` - an **EXPERIMENTAL** storyteller that creates a video of URI-M content suitable for posting to Twitter or YouTube

To use one of these storytellers, you must also supply the ``-o`` argument specifying the name of the output file.

For social media, Raintale provides the following ``storytellers``:

* ``twitter`` - publishes a story as a Twitter thread, with titles, URLs, memento-datetimes, and images supplied by MementoEmbed
* ``facebook`` - an **EXPERIMENTAL** storyteller that publishes a story as a Facebook thread, with titles, snippets, URLs, and memento-datetimes supplied by MementoEmbed; **it does not yet support image upload**

To use one of these storytellers, you must also supply the ``-c`` argument specifying the name of the file containing credentials in YAML format. For twitter, an example credentials file is shown below:

.. code-block::

    consumer_key: XXXXX
    consumer_secret: XXXXX
    access_token_key: XXXXX
    access_token_secret: XXXXX

Replace the values of ``XXXXX`` with the appropriate values for Twitter authentication. Visit https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps for more information on how to generate these values for your Twitter account.

Likewise, for using the **experimental** Facebook storyteller, the credentials file resembles the following:

.. code-block::

    page_id: XXXXX
    access_token: XXXXX

Visit https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens/ for more information on how to generate these values for your Facebook page.


Available presets
-----------------

Using the ``--preset`` option, Raintale provides options for configuring the output of a storyteller. New presets are templates that are provided as part of the Raintale release. New presets are added all of the time. The available presets are visible using ``tellstory --help``.
